## Turtle Intro
This is a very simple introduction to Turtle graphics. The turtle starts in the middle of the window, moves forward a small distance, turns right, moves forward a slightly longer distance, right again, even further this time… until the distance equals or exceeds a given limit.

Turtle graphics is a popular way for introducing programming to kids. It was part of the original Logo programming language developed by Wally Feurzig and Seymour Papert in 1966.

Imagine a robotic turtle starting at (0, 0) in the x-y plane. After an import turtle, give it the command turtle.forward(15), and it moves (on-screen!) 15 pixels in the direction it is facing, drawing a line as it moves. Give it the command turtle.right(25), and it rotates in-place 25 degrees clockwise.
