# plotterVS
Pen plotter repository for documenting pen plotter desing and usage.

## Background

IÂ´ve been using DIY pen plotters for a while, 3d printed mostly, they were a lot of fun, but those lack of being reliable. This model it's my 2nd iteration trying to solve that issue and wanting to get a good quality final product, based on my particular needs and understanding of the "best" desing that fits the purpose but keeping the costs as low as possible.
